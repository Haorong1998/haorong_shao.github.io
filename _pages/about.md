About me 
-------------
Welcome! I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at the [University of Lausanne (HEC Lausanne)](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home.html), under the supervision of Prof. [Gianluca Benigno](https://sites.google.com/view/gianlucabenigno)

My research focuses on the interaction between international trade, macroeconomic policy, and long-run growth, with particular attention to how trade imbalances and protectionist measures propagate through macro-financial channels. I aim to bridge theoretical growth models with quantitative policy analysis, addressing how external shocks and policy distortions affect innovation, productivity, and global economic stability. At the broadest level, my work seeks to understand how trade and financial policies shape the structure of production and the dynamics of adjustment in open economies.

My current research work consists of two related projects that form the core of this agenda: (1) [Tariff Wars and Endogenous Growth], and (2) [Trade Imbalances Externalities]. Together, they provide a unified framework to study how trade distortions and global savings imbalances interact with long-run growth, monetary policy, and welfare.
